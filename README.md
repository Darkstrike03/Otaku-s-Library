## 🚀 About

**Otaku’s Library** is an open-source, community-driven platform inspired by MyAnimeList, AniList, MangaUpdates and NovelUpdates — reimagined with a modern UI and collaborative data model.

We aim to be the one-stop hub to:
- Track and discover anime, manga, manhwa, manhua, donghua, light novels, and web novels.
- Explore trending titles, personal picks, and seasonal highlights.
- Contribute corrections, metadata, and new entries.
- Build a free, accurate, and community-maintained otaku database.

---

## ✨ Features

- Modern, responsive UI (React + Tailwind).
- Section-based layout (Hero, Trending, My Picks, Explore by Category).
- Community-contributed content: add/update entries, characters, staff, tags, and more.
- Free forever — no subscriptions or paywalls.
- Open-source and contributor-friendly.

---

## 🧾 Contribution Types

### You can help by:
- Adding or improving anime/manga/manhwa/manhua/novel entries.
- Correcting metadata (genres, release dates, staff).
- Adding characters, studios, or related media links.
- Improving UI, accessibility, and performance.
- Writing docs, examples, or tests.
### Every pull request will be reviewed — contributions are acknowledged in the contributors graph.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- Keep components modular and section-based to match the current layout (Section1..Section4).
- Use Tailwind utility classes; prefer backdrop-blur, gradient utilities, and responsive spacing.
- Keep the theme toggle (light/dark) consistent across components by relying on a top-level isDark prop or context.
- Icons should use lucide-react for consistency.
